# Scratch AI Coach

`Scratch AI Coach` is an open source companion app for `Scratch Desktop`. It does not modify the upstream Scratch source code. Instead, it launches Scratch in a controlled way, injects a read-only bridge, renders real Scratch-style blocks, and generates next-step hints from the learner's current project.

## Why This Project Exists

Scratch helped many people fall in love with computers for the first time. Since Scratch itself is open source, this project is being organized as a long-term open source repository too, so teachers, learners, and contributors can use it, review it, and evolve it in public.

## Current Scope

- The maintained product line is the **local desktop edition**
- Supported platforms: **Windows** and **macOS**
- The current workflow is “launch Scratch Desktop from the companion app, then attach a read-only bridge”
- No server code is included in the mainline yet; the teaching-oriented server edition is a future roadmap item
- Chinese is the primary product language today, while the core open source docs are bilingual

## What It Does Today

- Detects common Scratch installation paths, with manual fallback selection
- Launches `Scratch Desktop` in a controlled session and connects to it
- Reads the current target, project data, and script structure
- Renders the current scripts and recommended blocks with real `scratch-blocks`
- Generates AI next-step hints with an opcode allowlist for block safety
- Falls back to local hints when no online API key is configured

## Downloads and Release Flow

This repository does not publish GitHub Releases automatically yet. For now, official binaries are distributed through **GitHub Actions artifacts**:

- Windows artifact: `scratch-desktop-companion-windows`
  - includes a `portable .exe`
  - includes an `installer .exe`
- macOS artifact: `scratch-desktop-companion-macos`
  - includes a `.zip`
  - includes a `.dmg`

See [`docs/releasing.en.md`](docs/releasing.en.md) for workflow names, artifact naming, and packaging details.

## Local Development
